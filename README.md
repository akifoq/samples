Here you can find some examples of usage of specific TON mechanisms.

## Merkle
Create Merkle-proofs from Fift and check them in FunC.

## Libs
Upload a library with simple wallet code into masterchain, then create a wallet without storing its code.

## Libs-2
Put specific procedure definition into a library, then use it in another code. Also test the contract locally, setting specific library environment.

## conts, conts-1, const-2
Various examples of some kind of virtualization in TVM: storing function code in a cell, loading a function from a cell and executing it.

## Text (deprecated)
Deal with strings in FunC relatively convenient.

Deprecation note: newer versions of FunC support bultin string literals.

## callcc
Implement python-style generator with a continuation.

## callcc-2
An example of lazy evaluation: parse storage only once and on demand.

## asm-optimizations
Various assembly snippets for (un)common tasks. More efficient in gas than FunC counterparts.
